<h1>My Life</h1>


<h2>
  My Life as an Equestrian
</h2>
<p>I can't remember the day I fell in love with the beautiful creatures we call horses. But when I did it it has turned into a lifelong love. It is my drug, I belong on a horse's’ back, that is where I feel at home. My valiant steed is named Chai, yes like the tea. Him and I have seen some rough times. I actually tried selling him, everyone told me he would never be a jumping horse and I agreed. The funny thing is, anyone who came to look at him didn’t want to buy him because they said we made a great “team.” Chai would behave for me and do everything I asked, but when the people looking at him got on, he wouldn’t do a thing for them.  At the time I didn’t see it, but now I know they were right.  I have owned that stubborn and wonderful gelding for 7 years now. He has taught me more patience, perseverance and life lessons than anything in the world could have. Our journey has been one for the books, but now he is jumping at novice level eventing and we are working towards training level. I never thought that my little gelding would be able to fulfill my dream of jumping, but he has proved me wrong. 
 Once I graduate college and get a career, I will retire Chai as a jumping/dressage horse and use him for trail rides and cattle sorting (which he loves as well). Then get a talented, younger, green broke gelding to train to be my prelim (upper level) eventer. And basically start the process all over again that I went through with Chai. There is nothing more satisfying than successfully training a horse. When a rider gets in sync with their horse and they work as a team, it is pure magic. I wouldn’t trade that feeling for anything in the world.  
I couldn’t had accomplished what I have as a rider without the many trainers I’ve had throughout the years. Out of all the people who have influenced my riding, the two I look up to most are, Mike Kincella, and Buck Brannaman. Mike developed me as a rider, horsewoman, and helped me work through a lot of the foundational issues with Chai.
I have never actually met Buck Brannaman, I do read his books and watch his training videos and he is an amazing horseman. Both Mike and Buck have taught me how to be a horsewoman, not just a rider. You see, anyone can be a good rider, but it takes a special kind of person with a lot of patience to be a horseman. They key is to treat your horse like they are a part of a team. Not a slave to what you want. I have learned the hard way that working WITH your horse is far more productive than MAKING your horse do what you want. My life as an equestrian will continue throughout my entire life and I am excited to see where it takes me.
