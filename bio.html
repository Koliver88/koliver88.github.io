		My name is Katie Helm. June 11th 2016 I will be an Eastern Washington University Graduate. Throughout my college career I have been a Public Relations specialist intern for Dutch Bros of Spokane as well as a barista with Dutch for 5 years. Currently, I am a strategic marketing planner and customer service specialist for Power Products Unlimited. I am a busy gal, but aside from work and school I have many passions and interests. I&#39;m an equestrian, a hunter, a follower of Christ, fitness/health junkie, and lover of the outdoors. All of these activities I do with the companionship of my husband, family, friends and animals. As I am turning to a new page in life and closing another, I look forward to the changes, the challenges and the opportunity to further develop my skills and influence those around me within my career. This year will consist of getting established in my career, continuing training as an equestrian, free lance writing for the Outdoors sections of the Spokesman Review and other outdoors publications, serving at my church in the youth ministry, and spending quality time with my husband, friends and family. 2016, you've treated me well and I look forward to the road ahead.
