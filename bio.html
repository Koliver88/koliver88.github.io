	<h1>Bio & Resume</h1>

<h1><strong>Bio</strong></h1>

<p>My name is Kaitlyn Oliver, but I go by Katie. I&#39;m currently a student at Eastern Washington University, a Public Relations specialist intern for Dutch Bros of Spokane and a part time Barista at Dutch Bros. I am a busy gal, but aside from work and school I have many passions and interests. I&#39;m an equestrian, a hunter, a follower of Christ, fitness/health junkie, and lover of the outdoors. All of these activities I do with the companionship of family, friends and my animals. If I&#39;m not stuck at a desk doing homework, you can find me either on my horse, in the woods, in the gym or on some sort of adventure. </p>
